    <p class="lead" style="color:black">The main coal mine that the main Hopi community normally uses has shut down,
      which means people aren’t able to heat their homes, resulting in a lot of cold people. Many households are
      struggling to get the heating to survive. Plus, a handful of people lack whole roofs and windows, (or the entire
      thing altogether) which makes it extremely hard for heat to stay in. The Hopi and Navajo people have to get up
      around 3 times to check fire, which means they can’t get much sleep. But the elders have it worse. Some of them
      have to burn their own clothes for heat. In summary, the main issue is that the Hopi and Navajo tribes are
      struggling to get enough heating to survive, and need wood and/or coal.</p>
